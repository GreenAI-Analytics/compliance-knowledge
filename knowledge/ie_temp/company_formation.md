Choosing the right legal structure affects your tax, liability, governance, and reporting obligations. Irish businesses must register with the Companies Registration Office (CRO) or Revenue, depending on type.

Key points:

- Common structures include **Sole Trader, Partnership, Limited Company (LTD), Designated Activity Company (DAC), and CLG (non-profit)**.  
- Sole traders register with **Revenue** — simpler setup, but full personal liability.  
- Companies register with the **CRO** — must file a constitution, director details, and Form A1.  
- Limited companies offer **limited liability** — personal assets are protected if the business fails.  
- DACs and CLGs have specific purposes — e.g. regulated activities or charitable work.  
- Partnerships must register with Revenue — partners share profits and liabilities.  
- Choose a **company name** that’s unique and compliant — check availability on CRO.ie.  
- Appoint at least one **director and one secretary** — can be the same person in LTDs.  
- Open a **business bank account** — required for companies and recommended for sole traders.  
- Register for relevant **tax types** — e.g. VAT, PAYE, Corporation Tax, depending on structure.

**Tip:** Use [CRO.ie](https://www.cro.ie/) and [Revenue.ie](https://www.revenue.ie/) to compare structures and complete registration.
