Irish businesses operating across borders must comply with EU regulations, local laws, and international standards. This ensures legal certainty and market access.

Key points:

- Register for **VAT MOSS or OSS** if selling digital services or goods to EU consumers — simplifies multi-country VAT reporting.  
- Comply with **GDPR** for data transfers — use SCCs, adequacy decisions, or binding corporate rules.  
- Understand **country-specific employment, tax, and consumer laws** — especially when hiring or selling abroad.  
- Use **EORI numbers** for customs declarations — required for importing/exporting goods within and beyond the EU.  
- Monitor **EU directives and regulations** — e.g. CSRD, DAC7, DSA, and AI Act — many apply directly or via national law.  
- Cooperate with **foreign regulators** — respond to audits, inspections, or enforcement actions.  
- Maintain **transfer pricing documentation** — justify cross-border transactions between related entities.  
- Consider **double taxation treaties** — avoid duplicate tax liabilities and claim reliefs.  
- Use **EU funding and support programmes** — e.g. Horizon Europe, Enterprise Ireland, or Interreg.  
- Seek legal advice for **entity setup, licensing, and compliance** in other jurisdictions.
