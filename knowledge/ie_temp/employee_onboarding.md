Effective onboarding helps new employees settle in, understand their role, and comply with legal and workplace requirements. It also reduces turnover and improves performance.

Key points:

- Provide a written **Statement of Terms of Employment** within 5 days of starting — include job title, pay, hours, and start date.  
- Issue a full **contract of employment** within 1 month — covering duties, leave, notice, and disciplinary procedures.  
- Share your **employee handbook or policies** — including health and safety, data protection, equality, and grievance procedures.  
- Deliver a structured **induction programme** — introduce team members, explain systems, and outline expectations.  
- Provide **mandatory training** — such as health and safety, GDPR, anti-discrimination, and cybersecurity.  
- Assign a **buddy or mentor** to support the new hire during their first weeks.  
- Ensure access to necessary **equipment, systems, and logins** from day one.  
- Clarify **reporting lines and performance goals** — set expectations early.  
- Collect required documents — e.g. PPS number, bank details, proof of right to work.  
- Check in regularly during the first 3 months — offer feedback and address any concerns.

**Tip:** Use a simple onboarding checklist to track progress and ensure nothing is missed.
