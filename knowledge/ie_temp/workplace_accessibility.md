Employers must ensure equal access and inclusion for people with disabilities under the Employment Equality Acts and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Key points:

- Make your workplace **physically accessible** — consider ramps, lifts, signage, toilets, and parking.  
- Provide **reasonable accommodations** — such as flexible hours, assistive technology, adapted equipment, or remote work options.  
- Do not ask about disability during recruitment — unless accommodations are needed for the interview.  
- Train staff on **disability awareness and inclusive communication** — avoid assumptions or stereotypes.  
- Review job descriptions and tasks — ensure they don’t unnecessarily exclude people with disabilities.  
- Include accessibility in **IT systems and digital tools** — follow WCAG standards for websites and software.  
- Consult with employees — ask what supports they need and involve them in decisions.  
- Keep records of accommodations provided — and review them periodically.  
- Promote a culture of **respect, dignity, and inclusion** — include disability in your diversity strategy.  
- Cooperate with inspections or inquiries from the **Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)** or the **Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC)**.
