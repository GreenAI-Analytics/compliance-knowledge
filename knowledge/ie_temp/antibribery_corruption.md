Irish law prohibits bribery and corruption in all forms. Companies must implement controls to prevent unethical conduct and comply with the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018.

Key points:

- Bribery includes **offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting** anything of value to influence a person’s actions.  
- Applies to **public and private sector** — including foreign officials and third-party agents.  
- Companies can be held **criminally liable** for corrupt acts by employees, directors, or intermediaries.  
- Implement an **anti-bribery policy** — include definitions, reporting channels, disciplinary actions, and training.  
- Conduct **due diligence on suppliers, partners, and agents** — especially in high-risk jurisdictions or sectors.  
- Maintain records of **gifts, hospitality, donations, and sponsorships** — set thresholds and approval processes.  
- Train staff on **ethical conduct, red flags, and reporting procedures** — refresh annually.  
- Appoint a **compliance officer or ethics lead** — monitor risks and investigate concerns.  
- Report suspected offences to **An Garda Síochána or the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO)**.  
- Cooperate with audits and investigations — failure to prevent bribery can lead to fines or imprisonment.

**Tip:** Use the [SIPO guidance](https://www.sipo.ie/) and [Department of Justice resources](https://www.justice.ie/) to strengthen your anti-corruption framework.
