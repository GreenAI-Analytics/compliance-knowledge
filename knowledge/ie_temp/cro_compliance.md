All Irish companies must register with the Companies Registration Office (CRO) and meet ongoing filing obligations. This ensures legal recognition and transparency.

Key points:

- Choose a company type — most SMEs register as a **Private Company Limited by Shares (LTD)**.  
- Reserve your company name and file a **Form A1** with a constitution to incorporate.  
- Appoint at least **one EEA-resident director**, a company secretary, and a registered office address in Ireland.  
- Once incorporated, you’ll receive a **Certificate of Incorporation** and a company number.  
- File an **Annual Return (Form B1)** each year — the first is due 6 months after incorporation (no financial statements required), then annually.  
- Submit **financial statements** with your B1 from the second year onward (unless exempt).  
- Notify the CRO of changes — e.g. directors (Form B10), address (Form B2), share capital (Form B5), or beneficial ownership (RBO filing).  
- Maintain statutory registers — including directors, members, and beneficial owners.  
- Display your **company name and number** on websites, invoices, and correspondence.  
- Keep company records for at least **6 years** — including minutes, resolutions, and filings.

**Tip:** Use the [CRO’s CORE portal](https://core.cro.ie/) to file forms, check deadlines, and manage your company profile.
