Businesses must manage personal and business records in line with GDPR and Irish legal requirements. This includes setting clear retention periods, applying secure deletion practices, and ensuring staff are trained to handle records appropriately.

### ✅ Implementation Checklist

**Objective:** Ensure records are retained, deleted, and accessed in compliance with GDPR and Irish law.

#### 1. Establish a Retention Policy
- [ ] Create a **data retention schedule** listing record types, legal basis, and retention periods.  
- [ ] Include both **physical and digital records** in the policy.  
- [ ] Align with GDPR’s **storage limitation principle**.

#### 2. Apply Standard Retention Periods
- [ ] Keep tax, payroll, and employment records for **6 years**.  
- [ ] Retain CCTV footage for **up to 2 years** (unless needed for investigation).  
- [ ] Store unsuccessful job applications for **12 months**.  
- [ ] Retain marketing consent records **until consent is withdrawn**.

#### 3. Secure Deletion and Disposal
- [ ] Use secure methods (e.g., shredding, wiping, certified disposal) to delete expired data.  
- [ ] Document deletion actions — include date, method, and responsible person.

#### 4. Communicate and Train
- [ ] Update your **privacy notice** with retention periods.  
- [ ] Train HR, finance, and IT teams on retention and deletion procedures.

#### 5. Include Backups and Sector Rules
- [ ] Apply retention limits to **backups and archives**.  
- [ ] Check for **sector-specific retention rules** (e.g., healthcare, finance, education).

#### 6. Audit and Review
- [ ] Periodically review retention practices for compliance and efficiency.  
- [ ] Ensure records are **retrievable and well-organised** for audits or access requests.

#### 7. Resources
- [ ] Refer to [DPC guidance](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) on storage limitation and data retention.
