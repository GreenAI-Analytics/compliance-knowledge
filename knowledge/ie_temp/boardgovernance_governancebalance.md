Effective boards require a balanced mix of skills, independence, and oversight. Irish companies must meet legal and governance standards for board composition.

Key points:

- Private companies must have at least **one director** — public companies require **two or more**.  
- Directors must be **natural persons** — corporate directors are not permitted.  
- At least one director must be **resident in the EEA** — or the company must hold a bond.  
- Larger companies and regulated entities should appoint **independent non-executive directors (INEDs)** — support oversight and reduce conflicts.  
- Aim for diversity in **skills, experience, gender, and background** — improves decision-making and stakeholder trust.  
- Define roles clearly — e.g. **Chairperson, CEO, Company Secretary, Audit Committee**.  
- Separate **executive and non-executive functions** — avoid concentration of power.  
- Review board performance annually — assess effectiveness, attendance, and contribution.  
- Disclose board composition in **annual reports** — include biographies and independence status.  
- Follow governance codes — e.g. **UK Corporate Governance Code** or **Irish Funds Governance Code**, if applicable.
