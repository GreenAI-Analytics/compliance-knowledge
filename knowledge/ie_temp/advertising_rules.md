Marketing must be fair, truthful, and respectful of consumer rights. Irish law regulates advertising content, targeting practices, and use of personal data.

Key points:

- Comply with the **Consumer Protection Act 2007** — prohibits misleading, aggressive, or false advertising.  
- Ensure claims are **accurate, substantiated, and not exaggerated** — especially for health, financial, or environmental benefits.  
- Include **terms and conditions clearly** — especially for discounts, competitions, or limited offers.  
- Respect **data protection rules** — get consent before sending marketing emails, texts, or calls.  
- Allow easy **opt-out or unsubscribe** — and honour requests promptly.  
- Avoid targeting **vulnerable groups unfairly** — e.g. children, elderly, or financially distressed consumers.  
- Use **cookies and tracking tools lawfully** — provide notice and obtain consent where required.  
- Disclose **paid endorsements, influencer partnerships, and sponsored content** — use clear labels like #Ad or “Sponsored”.  
- Follow **sector-specific codes** — e.g. alcohol, gambling, or financial promotions.  
- Cooperate with the **Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)** and **Data Protection Commission (DPC)** if investigated.

**Tip:** Use the [ASAI Code of Standards](https://www.asai.ie/) and [CCPC guidance](https://www.ccpc.ie/) to ensure your campaigns are legally compliant and consumer-friendly.
