Cybersecurity is essential for protecting personal data, business continuity, and regulatory compliance. Irish organisations must prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats effectively.

Key points:

- Implement basic controls — **firewalls, antivirus, strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and software updates**.  
- Train staff on **phishing, social engineering, and secure practices** — refresh regularly.  
- Use **access controls and encryption** — limit data access to authorised users only.  
- Monitor systems for suspicious activity — use logs, alerts, and intrusion detection tools.  
- Prepare an **incident response plan** — define roles, escalation paths, and communication protocols.  
- If a breach occurs, assess impact and notify the **Data Protection Commission (DPC)** within **72 hours** if personal data is affected.  
- Inform affected individuals if the breach poses a high risk — explain what happened and how to protect themselves.  
- Document the breach — include timeline, actions taken, and lessons learned.  
- Review and improve controls post-incident — prevent recurrence and strengthen resilience.  
- Cooperate with regulators and law enforcement — provide evidence and support investigations.

**Tip:** Use the [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/) and [DPC breach guidance](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) to build a robust cybersecurity and breach response framework.
