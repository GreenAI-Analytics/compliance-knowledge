If your business is VAT-registered, you must charge VAT on taxable supplies and file returns regularly. Here’s what to keep in mind:

Key points:

- Register for VAT with Revenue once your turnover exceeds the relevant threshold (currently €75,000 for goods, €37,500 for services).  
- Charge VAT at the correct rate — standard (23%), reduced (13.5%, 9%), or zero — depending on the goods or services.  
- Issue VAT-compliant invoices showing your VAT number, rate applied, and total VAT charged.  
- File **VAT3 returns** every two months (or quarterly if approved). Submit via ROS by the **19th** of the following month (or **23rd** if filing online).  
- Pay VAT due by the same deadline to avoid interest or penalties.  
- Keep proper records: invoices, receipts, credit notes, and VAT calculations must be retained for **6 years**.  
- Claim input VAT only on allowable business expenses — ensure you have valid VAT invoices.  
- Use the **Reverse Charge** mechanism for certain cross-border services and construction-related supplies.  
- Apply the **VAT on Imports** rules correctly — use postponed accounting if eligible.  
- Notify Revenue of any changes to your VAT status, business activities, or contact details.
