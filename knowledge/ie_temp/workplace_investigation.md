Employers must handle complaints, misconduct, and grievances fairly and lawfully. A structured investigation process protects employee rights and reduces legal risk.

Key points:

- Have a clear **disciplinary and grievance procedure** — include steps for raising concerns, investigating, and appealing.  
- Follow the **Code of Practice on Grievance and Disciplinary Procedures** issued by the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  
- Appoint a **neutral investigator** — ideally someone not directly involved in the issue.  
- Gather evidence fairly — interview relevant parties, review documents, and maintain confidentiality.  
- Allow the employee to **respond to allegations** and bring a representative if desired.  
- Keep detailed **records of meetings, findings, and decisions** — share outcomes in writing.  
- Apply sanctions proportionately — e.g. verbal warning, written warning, suspension, or dismissal.  
- Allow for **appeal** — provide a separate person or panel to review the decision.  
- Avoid delays — act promptly while allowing time for fair review.  
- Train managers on investigation procedures and respectful handling of sensitive issues.

**Tip:** Use the [WRC templates and guidance](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/) to build compliant investigation and disciplinary policies.
