If your business operates a website, app, or online platform, you must meet legal obligations under consumer law, ePrivacy rules, and the Digital Services Act (DSA).

Key points:

- Provide clear **terms and conditions** for users — include service scope, user responsibilities, and dispute resolution.  
- Display a **privacy notice** explaining how you collect, use, and store personal data — this is required under GDPR.  
- Use a **cookie banner** that allows users to accept or reject non-essential cookies.  
- Ensure your website is **accessible** — follow WCAG 2.1 standards for navigation, contrast, and screen reader compatibility.  
- If you sell online, offer a **14-day right of withdrawal** for consumers, with clear instructions on how to cancel.  
- Clearly display **prices, delivery costs, and payment terms** before checkout.  
- Provide a **contact method** (email, phone, or contact form) and your business’s legal name and address.  
- If you host user-generated content (e.g. reviews, listings, forums), you may have duties under the **Digital Services Act** — including notice-and-action procedures for illegal content.  
- Protect users from scams, fake reviews, and misleading advertising — monitor and moderate your platform.  
- Keep records of key user interactions, complaints, and content moderation decisions.

**Tip:** Use the [EU Digital Services Act portal](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/) to check if your platform has additional obligations.
