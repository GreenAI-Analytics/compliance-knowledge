The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** sets out how Irish businesses must handle personal data.

Key points for small and medium enterprises (SMEs):

- Collect only the personal data you genuinely need for business purposes.  
- Store personal data securely and restrict access to staff who need it.  
- Maintain a short **Record of Processing Activities (ROPA)** — this helps demonstrate compliance.  
- Honor individual rights: access, correction, erasure, and portability requests must be handled within one month.  
- If you process large amounts of data or sensitive categories (like health data), appoint a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**.  
- Report certain data breaches to the **Data Protection Commission (DPC)** within **72 hours**.  
- Keep contracts in place with any service providers who handle data on your behalf.

**Tip:** The [Data Protection Commission (DPC)](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) offers free guidance tailored for small organizations.
