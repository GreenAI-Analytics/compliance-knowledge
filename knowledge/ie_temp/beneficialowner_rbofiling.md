Irish companies must identify and report their beneficial owners to the Central Register of Beneficial Ownership (RBO). This supports anti-money laundering (AML) and corporate transparency.

Key points:

- A **beneficial owner** is any individual who ultimately owns or controls more than **25%** of the company — directly or indirectly.  
- Companies must file details with the **RBO** within **5 months of incorporation** — and update within **14 days** of changes.  
- Required details include **name, date of birth, nationality, address, PPS number**, and nature of ownership/control.  
- If no individual meets the threshold, record **senior managing officials** as beneficial owners.  
- Keep an **internal register of beneficial owners** — separate from the RBO filing.  
- Access to RBO is restricted — full access for regulators and partial access for the public.  
- Non-compliance may result in **fines of up to €500,000** and criminal prosecution.  
- Trusts, partnerships, and certain funds have **separate registers** — check sector-specific rules.  
- Use the **RBO online portal** for filings, updates, and guidance.  
- Cooperate with AML checks — banks, accountants, and legal firms may request RBO confirmation.
