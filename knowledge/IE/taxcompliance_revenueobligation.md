Irish businesses must register for the correct taxes, file returns on time, and keep accurate records. Non-compliance can lead to penalties, audits, or prosecution.

Key points:

- Register with **Revenue** for relevant taxes — e.g. VAT, PAYE, Corporation Tax, RCT (construction), or Capital Gains.  
- File returns and pay taxes **on time** — monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on tax type and turnover.  
- Issue **valid VAT invoices** — include VAT number, rate, and breakdown.  
- Operate **PAYE correctly** — deduct income tax, USC, and PRSI from employee wages and report via Revenue Online Service (ROS).  
- Keep records for at least **6 years** — including invoices, receipts, payroll, and bank statements.  
- Use **MyAccount or ROS** to manage tax registrations, returns, and payments.  
- Apply for **tax clearance certificates** — often required for public contracts or grants.  
- Cooperate with **Revenue audits or compliance checks** — provide access to records and explanations.  
- Seek professional advice for **cross-border, capital, or restructuring transactions**.  
- Avoid underreporting or late filing — penalties include interest, fines, and reputational damage.
