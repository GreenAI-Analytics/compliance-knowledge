Remote work arrangements must comply with employment law, data protection, health and safety, and contractual obligations. Clear policies help manage expectations and reduce risk.

Key points:

- Define a **remote work policy** — include eligibility, expectations, equipment, hours, and communication norms.  
- Ensure **employment contracts** reflect remote arrangements — update terms if location or duties change.  
- Comply with **working time rules** — track hours, breaks, and overtime fairly.  
- Conduct a **remote workstation risk assessment** — check ergonomics, lighting, and safety.  
- Provide necessary **equipment and support** — e.g. laptops, software, VPN, and IT helpdesk access.  
- Maintain **data protection standards** — use secure connections, device encryption, and access controls.  
- Train staff on **cybersecurity and confidentiality** — especially when handling personal or sensitive data.  
- Clarify **expenses and reimbursements** — e.g. internet, phone, or home office costs.  
- Promote **inclusion and wellbeing** — avoid isolation and ensure equal access to opportunities.  
- Review remote arrangements regularly — adjust based on performance, feedback, or legal changes.

**Tip:** Use the [Health and Safety Authority’s remote work guidance](https://www.hsa.ie/) to assess home workstations and meet safety obligations.
