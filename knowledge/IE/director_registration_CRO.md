Irish companies must register directors and file statutory documents with the Companies Registration Office (CRO). These filings ensure legal transparency and corporate accountability.

Key points:

- Appoint at least **one director aged 18+** — must not be disqualified or bankrupt.  
- File a **Form A1** when incorporating — includes director details, company name, constitution, and registered office.  
- Submit a **Form B10** to update director or secretary details — e.g. appointment, resignation, or change of address.  
- Maintain a **Register of Directors and Secretaries** — include full name, address, nationality, DOB, and occupation.  
- File an **Annual Return (Form B1)** — includes financial statements and director confirmations.  
- Disclose **beneficial ownership** separately via the Central Register of Beneficial Ownership (CRBO).  
- Notify the CRO of changes to the **registered office, company name, or constitution** — using appropriate forms.  
- Keep records of filings, board minutes, and resolutions — retain for at least **6 years**.  
- Directors must comply with **fiduciary and statutory duties** — failure can lead to fines or disqualification.  
- Use the **CORE portal** to file online — check deadlines and document status.
