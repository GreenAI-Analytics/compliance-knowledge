Companies may restructure for strategic, financial, or operational reasons. Strike-off and liquidation must follow legal procedures to avoid penalties or future liability.

Key points:

- Common restructuring actions include **mergers, demergers, share buybacks, and changes to legal structure or ownership**.  
- Update the **CRO** with changes to directors, constitution, share capital, or registered office — use appropriate forms.  
- Consider tax, legal, and regulatory impacts — seek advice before executing major changes.  
- Voluntary strike-off requires filing a **Form H1** — company must be solvent, inactive, and up to date with filings.  
- Involuntary strike-off may occur due to **non-filing of returns or unpaid fees** — can lead to fines or director disqualification.  
- Liquidation involves appointing a **liquidator** — who settles debts, distributes assets, and files final accounts.  
- Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation (CVL) applies when the company is insolvent — requires shareholder and creditor approval.  
- Members’ Voluntary Liquidation (MVL) applies when solvent — must file a declaration of solvency.  
- Keep records of resolutions, filings, and communications — retain for at least **6 years**.  
- Notify stakeholders — including employees, creditors, customers, and regulators.
