Certain sectors require licences, permits, or authorisations before operating. These vary by industry and are enforced by specialist regulators.

Key points:

- Identify if your business falls under a **regulated sector** — e.g. financial services, healthcare, food, transport, childcare, or construction.  
- Apply for the correct **licence or registration** — check with the relevant authority (e.g. Central Bank, HSE, FSAI, RSA, Tusla, or SEAI).  
- Meet **fit and proper person tests** — including qualifications, experience, and criminal record checks.  
- Submit required documents — e.g. insurance, safety statements, policies, or financial accounts.  
- Pay any **application or renewal fees** — some licences require annual renewal or periodic review.  
- Display licences publicly if required — e.g. food premises, taxis, or childcare centres.  
- Comply with **ongoing obligations** — such as inspections, reporting, or staff training.  
- Notify regulators of **material changes** — e.g. ownership, premises, or service scope.  
- Keep records of licences and correspondence — useful for audits or enforcement queries.  
- Cooperate with enforcement bodies — failure to comply can lead to fines, closure, or prosecution.
