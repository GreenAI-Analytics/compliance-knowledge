Businesses must treat consumers fairly and transparently under Irish and EU consumer law. These rules apply to sales, advertising, contracts, and complaints handling.

Key points:

- Provide clear, accurate **product descriptions** — avoid misleading claims in advertising, packaging, or online listings.  
- Display **total prices** upfront, including VAT and any mandatory fees.  
- Offer a **14-day cooling-off period** for online, phone, or off-premises sales — consumers can cancel without giving a reason.  
- Honour **refunds, repairs, or replacements** for faulty goods — consumers have rights for up to 6 years under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  
- Deliver goods and services within the agreed timeframe — delays may entitle the customer to cancel.  
- Use **fair contract terms** — avoid hidden clauses, excessive penalties, or unclear language.  
- Handle complaints promptly and respectfully — keep a record of issues raised and how they were resolved.  
- Train staff on consumer rights and how to respond to queries or disputes.  
- If selling online, include a **privacy notice**, terms and conditions, and contact details.  
- Cooperate with the **Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)** in case of investigations or enforcement.
