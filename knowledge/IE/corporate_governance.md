Strong governance helps protect your business from legal, financial, and reputational risk. It also builds trust with regulators, investors, and customers.

Key points:

- Appoint at least one director who is **resident in the EEA**. If not, you’ll need a bond or exemption.  
- Maintain accurate **statutory registers** — including directors, shareholders, beneficial owners, and charges.  
- File **annual returns and financial statements** with the Companies Registration Office (CRO) on time. Late filings can lead to fines or strike-off.  
- Ensure directors understand their **legal duties**: act in good faith, avoid conflicts of interest, and maintain proper books of account.  
- Hold and minute **board meetings** regularly, even if informal. This helps document decisions and oversight.  
- Identify and manage **conflicts of interest** using declarations and clear policies.  
- Comply with **Beneficial Ownership regulations** by registering and updating the Register of Beneficial Owners (RBO).  
- Review governance policies annually — including ethics, whistleblowing, risk management, and data protection.  
- Assign someone to **track compliance deadlines and filings**. This doesn’t require a full-time role but should be clearly delegated.

**Tip:** Use a simple governance calendar to track filings, board meetings, and policy reviews throughout the year.
