Irish consumers have strong rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2022 and EU law. Businesses must offer fair terms, clear information, and prompt remedies.

Key points:

- Consumers have a **right to a refund, repair, or replacement** if goods are faulty, not as described, or unfit for purpose.  
- Refunds must be issued within **14 days** of agreement — using the original payment method.  
- Online and distance purchases include a **14-day cooling-off period** — no reason required unless exempt (e.g. custom goods).  
- Provide clear **terms and conditions** — including return process, timeframes, and exclusions.  
- Honour **warranties and guarantees** — these are in addition to statutory rights.  
- Do not mislead consumers — advertising, pricing, and product descriptions must be accurate.  
- Handle complaints fairly — offer accessible channels and respond promptly.  
- Train staff on consumer law — especially sales, support, and returns teams.  
- Keep records of transactions, returns, and communications — useful for audits or disputes.  
- Cooperate with the **Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)** if investigated.
