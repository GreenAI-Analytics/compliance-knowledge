Employers must provide clear contracts and respect core employee rights under Irish employment law. These rules apply to all staff, including part-time and fixed-term workers.

Key points:

- Provide a written **Statement of Terms of Employment** within 5 days of starting work. This must include job title, pay, hours, and start date.  
- Issue a full **contract of employment** within 1 month, covering duties, notice periods, leave entitlements, and disciplinary procedures.  
- Pay at least the **national minimum wage** — currently €12.70 per hour (as of 2025).  
- Ensure employees receive **paid annual leave** (4 weeks minimum) and **public holiday entitlements**.  
- Respect limits on **working hours** — maximum 48 hours per week averaged over 4 months.  
- Provide **rest breaks**: 15 minutes after 4.5 hours, 30 minutes after 6 hours.  
- Allow for **parental, maternity, paternity, and sick leave** as set out in legislation.  
- Protect employees from **unfair dismissal** — valid reasons and fair procedures are required.  
- Avoid discrimination in recruitment, pay, promotion, or dismissal — based on gender, age, race, religion, disability, etc.  
- Keep employment records for at least **3 years**, including contracts, payslips, and working time logs.

**Tip:** Use templates from the [Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/) to create compliant contracts and policies.
