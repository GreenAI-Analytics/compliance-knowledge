Irish employers must offer access to a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) if no occupational pension is in place. This supports long-term financial wellbeing and meets legal obligations.

Key points:

- If no occupational pension is offered, employers must provide access to a **Standard PRSA** — and facilitate payroll deductions.  
- PRSA access must be offered to **all employees** — including part-time, fixed-term, and contract staff.  
- Employers are not required to contribute — but must allow employee contributions via payroll.  
- Provide employees with **information about PRSA options** — including approved providers and contact details.  
- Ensure PRSA deductions are **processed accurately and on time** — and passed to the provider promptly.  
- Keep records of PRSA access, communications, and deductions — retain for at least **6 years**.  
- Review pension arrangements regularly — especially if expanding or restructuring.  
- Consider offering an **occupational pension scheme** — may be more attractive and tax-efficient.  
- Cooperate with inspections or queries from the **Pensions Authority**.  
- Avoid misleading or coercive behaviour — employees must choose freely and without pressure.

**Tip:** Use the [Pensions Authority guidance](https://www.pensionsauthority.ie/) to understand PRSA rules and improve retirement benefits.
