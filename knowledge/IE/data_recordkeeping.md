Irish organisations must retain records for defined periods to meet legal, tax, and regulatory obligations — but not longer than necessary under GDPR.

Key points:

- Apply the **storage limitation principle** — only keep personal data as long as needed for the purpose collected.  
- Maintain a **data retention schedule** — list record types, legal basis, and retention periods.  
- Common retention periods:
  - **6 years** for tax, payroll, and employment records (Revenue and WRC requirements)  
  - **2 years** for CCTV footage (unless needed for investigation)  
  - **12 months** for unsuccessful job applications  
  - **Until consent withdrawn** for marketing preferences  
- Securely delete or anonymise data once no longer needed — use shredding, wiping, or certified disposal.  
- Document deletion processes — include dates, methods, and responsible staff.  
- Inform data subjects of retention periods in your **privacy notice**.  
- Apply sector-specific rules — e.g. healthcare, finance, education may require longer retention.  
- Backups must also respect retention limits — include in your data lifecycle planning.  
- Cooperate with audits or access requests — ensure records are retrievable and well-organised.  
- Train staff on retention policies — especially HR, finance, and IT teams.

**Tip:** Use the [DPC’s guidance on storage limitation](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) to align your retention policy with GDPR and Irish law.
