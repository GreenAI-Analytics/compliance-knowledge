Hiring non-EEA nationals requires employment permits and immigration compliance. Employers must follow Department of Enterprise and Department of Justice rules.

Key points:

- Determine if the role qualifies for an **employment permit** — check the **Critical Skills** and **General Employment** lists.  
- Apply via the **Employment Permits Online System (EPOS)** — include job details, salary, qualifications, and company info.  
- Meet minimum salary thresholds — e.g. €34,000 for general permits, €38,000+ for critical skills.  
- Ensure the role is **genuine and full-time** — and not on the ineligible occupations list.  
- Provide a signed **contract of employment** — include duties, hours, location, and terms.  
- Pay the relevant **permit fee** — varies by duration and permit type.  
- Once approved, the employee must apply for a **visa and register with immigration** — e.g. GNIB/IRP card.  
- Keep copies of permits, contracts, and immigration documents — retain for at least **6 years**.  
- Notify authorities of changes — e.g. early termination, role changes, or address updates.  
- Cooperate with inspections — non-compliance can lead to fines or restrictions on future hiring.

**Tip:** Use the [Employment Permits portal](https://enterprise.gov.ie/) and [Irish Immigration Service](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/) for eligibility checks and application guidance.
