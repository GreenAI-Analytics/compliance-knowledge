Cybersecurity is essential for protecting personal data, business continuity, and regulatory compliance. Irish businesses must take reasonable steps to prevent breaches and respond effectively.

Key points:

- Conduct regular **risk assessments** — identify vulnerabilities in systems, processes, and access controls.  
- Implement **technical safeguards** — such as firewalls, antivirus software, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and encryption.  
- Maintain **access controls** — restrict data and system access based on roles and responsibilities.  
- Keep software and systems **up to date** — apply patches and updates promptly.  
- Train staff on **cyber hygiene** — including phishing awareness, password security, and safe browsing.  
- Monitor for **suspicious activity** — use logging, alerts, and intrusion detection systems.  
- Have a **data breach response plan** — outline how incidents are detected, contained, reported, and recovered.  
- Report serious breaches to the **Data Protection Commission (DPC)** within 72 hours.  
- Back up critical data regularly — store backups securely and test recovery procedures.  
- Review cybersecurity policies annually — update based on threats, technology, and legal changes.
