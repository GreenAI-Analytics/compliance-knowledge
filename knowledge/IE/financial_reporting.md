Irish companies must prepare and file accurate financial statements each year. These obligations help ensure transparency, legal compliance, and tax accuracy.

Key points:

- Prepare **annual financial statements** — including a balance sheet, profit and loss account, and notes.  
- File an **Annual Return (Form B1)** with the Companies Registration Office (CRO) — typically due within 56 days of your company’s annual return date (ARD).  
- Submit **financial statements** with your B1 if your company is not audit-exempt.  
- Small companies may qualify for **audit exemption** — check thresholds for turnover, balance sheet total, and employee numbers.  
- Keep proper **books and records** — including invoices, receipts, bank statements, and payroll data — for at least **6 years**.  
- Ensure financial statements comply with **Irish GAAP** or **IFRS**, depending on your company type.  
- Directors must approve and sign the accounts — include a **Directors’ Report** and **Statement of Responsibilities**.  
- File **Corporation Tax returns (Form CT1)** with Revenue annually — include financial data and tax computations.  
- Pay any tax due by the deadline to avoid interest or penalties.  
- Engage a qualified accountant or auditor if needed — especially for complex structures or regulatory oversight.
