Certain sectors in Ireland require licences, authorisations, or registrations before operating. These ensure safety, integrity, and regulatory oversight.

Key points:

- **Financial services** must be authorised by the **Central Bank of Ireland** — includes lenders, insurers, investment firms, and payment providers.  
- **Healthcare providers** need registration with **HIQA** or professional bodies — e.g. Medical Council, Nursing Board.  
- **Education and childcare** services must register with **Tusla** — meet staffing, safety, and curriculum standards.  
- **Food businesses** require approval from the **FSAI** and local authorities — includes hygiene, traceability, and allergen controls.  
- **Transport operators** need licences from the **National Transport Authority (NTA)** or **RSA** — e.g. taxis, buses, haulage.  
- **Construction firms** may need **Safe Pass, CSCS cards, and RCT registration** — plus planning and environmental permits.  
- **Gambling and gaming** businesses require licences from the **Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland** (phased in from 2024).  
- **Energy and telecoms** providers must register with **CRU or ComReg** — includes grid access, tariffs, and consumer protection.  
- Keep licences up to date — renew before expiry and notify regulators of changes.  
- Display licences where required — and cooperate with inspections or audits.

**Tip:** Use sector regulator portals (e.g. [centralbank.ie](https://www.centralbank.ie/), [fsai.ie](https://www.fsai.ie/), [hiqa.ie](https://www.hiqa.ie/)) to check licensing requirements and application steps.
