Employers must provide a safe and healthy working environment under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. This applies to all workplaces, including offices, remote setups, and field operations.

Key points:

- Prepare a written **Safety Statement** — outline risks, control measures, and responsibilities.  
- Conduct regular **risk assessments** — identify hazards and document how they’re managed.  
- Appoint a **competent person** to oversee health and safety — this can be internal or external.  
- Provide **training and supervision** — ensure staff know how to work safely and use equipment properly.  
- Maintain **first aid kits, fire extinguishers, and emergency procedures** — test alarms and drills regularly.  
- Record and report **accidents, injuries, and near misses** — notify the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) of serious incidents.  
- Ensure **ergonomic workstations** — especially for desk-based or remote workers.  
- Provide **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** where needed — and ensure it’s used correctly.  
- Display the **Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 Summary Poster** in a visible location.  
- Review your safety systems annually — update based on incidents, inspections, or workplace changes.

**Tip:** Use the [HSA’s BeSMART tool](https://www.besmart.ie/) to create a tailored risk assessment and safety statement.
