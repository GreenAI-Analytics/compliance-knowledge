If your organisation raises funds from the public or operates as a charity, you must follow strict rules on transparency, governance, and financial reporting.

Key points:

- Register with the **Charities Regulator** if your organisation meets the legal definition of a charity.  
- Apply for a **CHY number** from Revenue to access tax exemptions and issue donation receipts.  
- Maintain a **governing document** — such as a constitution or trust deed — outlining your charitable purpose and governance structure.  
- Keep proper **books and records** — including income, expenditure, donor details, and fundraising activities.  
- File an **Annual Report** and **financial statements** with the Charities Regulator.  
- Follow the **Charities Governance Code** — covering board duties, risk management, and transparency.  
- Ensure fundraising is **honest and respectful** — avoid misleading appeals or pressure tactics.  
- Provide clear information about how donations are used — especially for restricted or emergency campaigns.  
- Train staff and volunteers on **ethical fundraising practices** and data protection.  
- Cooperate with inspections or investigations — keep records for at least **6 years**.

**Tip:** Use the [Charities Regulator’s toolkit](https://www.charitiesregulator.ie/) to build compliant governance and fundraising systems.
