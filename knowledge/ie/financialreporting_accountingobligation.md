Irish companies must maintain proper accounts and file financial reports with the Companies Registration Office (CRO). Requirements vary by company size and structure.

Key points:

- Keep accurate **books of account** — record income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash flow.  
- Prepare **annual financial statements** — include balance sheet, profit and loss, notes, and director report.  
- File an **Annual Return (Form B1)** with the CRO — include financial statements and director confirmations.  
- Small companies may file **abridged accounts** — if they meet two of three criteria: turnover < €12m, balance sheet < €6m, <50 employees.  
- Medium and large companies must file **full audited accounts** — signed by a registered auditor.  
- Directors must approve and sign the accounts — confirm accuracy and compliance.  
- Submit filings **on time** — late returns incur penalties and loss of audit exemption.  
- Maintain records for at least **6 years** — including invoices, receipts, bank statements, and payroll.  
- Comply with **accounting standards** — e.g. FRS 102 or IFRS, depending on company type.  
- Cooperate with audits and inspections — provide access to records and explanations.
