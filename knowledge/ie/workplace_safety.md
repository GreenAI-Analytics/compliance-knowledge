Employers are legally responsible for ensuring a safe and healthy working environment. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 sets out core duties.

Key points:

- Prepare a written **Safety Statement** that outlines risks and how they are managed. Review it annually or after significant changes.  
- Conduct regular **risk assessments** for all work activities — including manual handling, equipment use, and lone working.  
- Appoint a **competent person** to manage health and safety — this can be internal or external.  
- Provide **training and supervision** to ensure staff can work safely. Keep records of all training delivered.  
- Report serious workplace accidents, injuries, or dangerous occurrences to the **Health and Safety Authority (HSA)** using Form IR1.  
- Maintain records of incidents, near misses, and safety inspections.  
- Ensure **first aid supplies** are available and staff know who the designated first aiders are.  
- Display the **Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 Summary Poster** in a visible location.  
- Provide appropriate **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** where risks cannot be eliminated.  
- Engage with employees on safety matters — through safety reps or informal feedback.

**Tip:** Use the [HSA’s BeSMART tool](https://www.besmart.ie/) to create a free, tailored safety statement for your business.
