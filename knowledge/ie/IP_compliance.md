Protecting intellectual property (IP) helps safeguard your brand, products, and creative work. It also reduces the risk of infringement disputes and lost revenue.

Key points:

- Identify your IP assets — this includes logos, brand names, product designs, written content, software, inventions, and trade secrets.  
- Register **trademarks** for names, logos, and slogans via the Intellectual Property Office of Ireland (IPOI).  
- Consider **patents** for inventions or technical solutions — this provides exclusive rights for up to 20 years.  
- Use **copyright** to protect original works — such as written materials, designs, music, and software. Copyright applies automatically but registration can help in disputes.  
- Include IP clauses in contracts with staff, freelancers, and suppliers — clarify ownership of work created during engagement.  
- Monitor for **infringement** — watch for unauthorised use of your brand, content, or products online and offline.  
- Avoid infringing others’ IP — check licences, permissions, and usage rights before using third-party content.  
- Use **NDAs and confidentiality clauses** to protect trade secrets and sensitive business information.  
- Keep records of IP registrations, renewals, and enforcement actions.  
- Review IP strategy annually — especially when launching new products, entering new markets, or updating branding.

**Tip:** Use the [IPOI website](https://www.ipoi.gov.ie/) to search existing trademarks and patents before filing or launching.
