Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting is increasingly expected by regulators, investors, and stakeholders. Larger companies may be legally required to disclose ESG metrics under EU rules.

Key points:

- Identify your ESG impacts — including carbon emissions, energy use, waste, diversity, labour practices, and governance.  
- If you meet thresholds, you may be subject to the **Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)** — mandatory from 2026 for many Irish companies.  
- Use recognised frameworks — such as **GRI**, **SASB**, or **ESRS** — to structure your ESG disclosures.  
- Collect reliable data — e.g. energy bills, travel logs, supplier audits, employee surveys, and board diversity stats.  
- Disclose ESG risks and mitigation strategies — e.g. climate adaptation, supply chain ethics, or governance reforms.  
- Include ESG information in your **management report** or publish a separate sustainability report.  
- Ensure board oversight — ESG should be integrated into strategy, risk, and performance reviews.  
- Engage stakeholders — consult staff, customers, and investors on ESG priorities.  
- Monitor progress — set targets and track year-on-year improvements.  
- Be transparent — avoid greenwashing and back up claims with evidence.

**Tip:** Use the [Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)](https://www.centralbank.ie/) and [CSRD guidance](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/) to check if your company is in scope.
