Irish law protects workers who report wrongdoing in the public interest. Employers must provide safe, confidential channels for disclosures and protect whistleblowers from retaliation.

Key points:

- Comply with the **Protected Disclosures Act 2014 (as amended)** — applies to employees, contractors, trainees, and volunteers.  
- A protected disclosure must relate to **relevant wrongdoing** — e.g. criminal offences, health and safety risks, misuse of public funds, or regulatory breaches.  
- Establish a **confidential internal reporting channel** — accessible, secure, and independent.  
- Appoint a **designated person** to receive and assess disclosures — trained in confidentiality and fair treatment.  
- Acknowledge receipt within **7 days** and provide feedback within **3 months**.  
- Protect whistleblowers from **penalisation or dismissal** — including demotion, harassment, or unfair treatment.  
- Keep records securely — limit access and retain only as long as necessary.  
- Inform staff of their rights and reporting options — including external channels like the Protected Disclosures Commissioner.  
- Larger employers (50+ staff) must meet **additional obligations** under the EU Whistleblowing Directive.  
- Review and update your whistleblowing policy annually — ensure alignment with legal changes and best practice.
