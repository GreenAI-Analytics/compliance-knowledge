Internal audits and controls help organisations manage risk, ensure compliance, and improve operational effectiveness. They’re essential for governance, especially in regulated or high-risk sectors.

Key points:

- Define an **internal audit plan** — identify key risks, processes, and controls to be reviewed.  
- Appoint an **independent auditor or audit team** — internal or external, depending on scale and complexity.  
- Use a **risk-based approach** — focus on areas with financial, legal, operational, or reputational exposure.  
- Document **policies and procedures** — ensure controls are clear, consistent, and accessible.  
- Test controls regularly — e.g. approvals, reconciliations, access logs, segregation of duties.  
- Report findings to **senior management or the board** — include recommendations and timelines.  
- Track **corrective actions** — assign owners, set deadlines, and follow up.  
- Maintain an **audit trail** — keep records of reviews, evidence, and decisions.  
- Review audit scope annually — adjust based on incidents, changes, or strategic priorities.  
- Align with frameworks like **COSO**, **ISO 37301**, or sector-specific standards.
