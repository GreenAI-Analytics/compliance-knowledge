Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting is increasingly mandatory under EU law. Irish companies must disclose sustainability impacts, risks, and performance.

Key points:

- Large companies must comply with the **Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)** — phased in from 2024.  
- Disclosures must follow **European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)** — covering environment, social, and governance topics.  
- Report on **climate risks, emissions, energy use, diversity, human rights, and governance** — include policies, targets, and outcomes.  
- Conduct a **double materiality assessment** — identify what affects the company and what the company affects.  
- Include ESG data in the **management report** — audited and filed with financial statements.  
- SMEs may be exempt initially — but voluntary reporting is encouraged for transparency and investor readiness.  
- Align with frameworks like **TCFD, GRI, or SASB** — especially for global comparability.  
- Use digital formats and **tagged data** — supports EU-wide access and analysis.  
- Involve stakeholders — consult employees, customers, suppliers, and investors.  
- Review ESG strategy annually — update based on performance, regulation, and stakeholder feedback.
