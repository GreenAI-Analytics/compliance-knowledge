Businesses must comply with environmental laws covering emissions, waste, water, and resource use. Permits and reporting obligations vary by activity and sector.

Key points:

- Identify if your operations require an **EPA licence or local authority permit** — e.g. manufacturing, waste handling, or emissions.  
- Apply for the correct **Integrated Pollution Control (IPC), Industrial Emissions (IE), or Waste Facility Permit**.  
- Comply with **waste management rules** — segregate, store, transport, and dispose of waste safely.  
- Use **authorised waste collectors** — check registration and keep records of transfers.  
- Submit **Annual Environmental Reports (AERs)** if licensed — include emissions, incidents, and improvement plans.  
- Monitor and report **air, water, and noise emissions** — use accredited labs and follow EPA guidelines.  
- Avoid illegal dumping or pollution — penalties include fines, prosecution, and licence revocation.  
- Train staff on **environmental responsibilities and emergency procedures** — especially in high-risk sectors.  
- Cooperate with inspections and audits — provide access, records, and corrective actions.  
- Review permits and obligations annually — update based on changes in operations or law.

**Tip:** Use the [EPA licensing portal](https://www.epa.ie/) and [MyWaste.ie](https://www.mywaste.ie/) to manage permits and waste compliance.
