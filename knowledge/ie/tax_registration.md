All businesses must register with Revenue and meet ongoing tax filing obligations. This includes income tax, VAT, payroll taxes, and corporation tax depending on your structure and activities.

Key points:

- Register for tax using **Revenue’s eRegistration system** — select the taxes relevant to your business (e.g. income tax, VAT, PAYE, corporation tax).  
- Sole traders register for **Income Tax**; companies register for **Corporation Tax**.  
- Register for **VAT** if turnover exceeds €75,000 (goods) or €37,500 (services) — or voluntarily if below threshold.  
- If you employ staff, register for **PAYE/PRSI/USC** — and operate payroll through Revenue’s **Real Time Reporting (RTS)** system.  
- File **tax returns** on time — monthly/bi-monthly for VAT, quarterly for PAYE, annually for income or corporation tax.  
- Keep proper **books and records** — including invoices, receipts, payroll, and bank statements.  
- Pay taxes electronically via **ROS (Revenue Online Service)** — set up direct debit or manual payments.  
- Claim allowable **deductions and credits** — e.g. business expenses, capital allowances, R&D tax credits.  
- Respond to Revenue queries or audits — provide records and explanations as needed.  
- Retain tax records for at least **6 years** — in case of inspection or dispute.
