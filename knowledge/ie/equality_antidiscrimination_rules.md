Employers and service providers must treat people fairly and avoid discrimination under the Employment Equality Acts and Equal Status Acts.

Key points:

- Do not discriminate based on **gender, age, race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, civil status, family status, or membership of the Traveller community**.  
- Apply fair and transparent criteria in **recruitment, promotion, pay, and dismissal** decisions.  
- Provide **reasonable accommodations** for employees with disabilities — such as adapted equipment, flexible hours, or accessible facilities.  
- Avoid discriminatory language or imagery in job ads, marketing, or internal communications.  
- Ensure **equal access to training, development, and benefits** for all staff.  
- Investigate complaints of discrimination or harassment promptly and fairly.  
- Maintain a clear **anti-discrimination and dignity at work policy** — share it with staff and review it annually.  
- Train managers and staff on equality obligations and respectful workplace behaviour.  
- Monitor diversity and inclusion metrics — such as gender balance, pay equity, and representation.  
- Cooperate with inspections or inquiries from the **Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)**.
