Procurement involves more than just price — businesses must assess supplier reliability, legal compliance, and ethical standards. This protects against fraud, reputational damage, and regulatory breaches.

Key points:

- Use a **standardised procurement process** — define how suppliers are selected, evaluated, and approved.  
- Conduct **due diligence** before contracting — check legal status, financial health, insurance, and regulatory history.  
- Include clear **contract terms** — covering delivery timelines, payment terms, confidentiality, data protection, and dispute resolution.  
- Require suppliers to comply with relevant laws — including GDPR, health and safety, labour rights, and environmental rules.  
- Ask for evidence of **certifications or licences** where applicable (e.g. waste handling, construction, financial services).  
- Monitor supplier performance — track delivery quality, responsiveness, and compliance with agreed terms.  
- Maintain a **supplier register** with contact details, contract dates, and risk ratings.  
- Avoid conflicts of interest — document any personal or financial links between staff and suppliers.  
- Include **termination clauses** for breach of contract, non-compliance, or ethical violations.  
- Review supplier relationships annually — update contracts and risk assessments as needed.

**Tip:** Use a simple supplier questionnaire to screen for compliance, sustainability, and ethical risks before onboarding.
