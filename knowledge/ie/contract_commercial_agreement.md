Contracts are legally binding agreements that define rights, obligations, and remedies. Irish businesses must ensure contracts are clear, fair, and enforceable.

Key points:

- A valid contract requires **offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations**.  
- Contracts can be **written, verbal, or implied** — but written agreements are easier to enforce.  
- Include key terms — e.g. scope of work, payment, timelines, termination, liability, and dispute resolution.  
- Avoid vague or contradictory clauses — use plain language and define technical terms.  
- Ensure both parties have **capacity and authority** to enter the agreement.  
- Comply with **consumer protection laws** if contracting with individuals — include cancellation rights and fair terms.  
- Use **standard templates** for common agreements — e.g. NDAs, service contracts, supplier terms.  
- Review contracts before signing — consider legal advice for complex or high-risk deals.  
- Keep signed copies and correspondence — store securely and track expiry or renewal dates.  
- Resolve disputes via **negotiation, mediation, or court** — include a jurisdiction clause to clarify venue.
