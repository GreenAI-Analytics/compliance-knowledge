Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting helps businesses demonstrate their impact and commitment to responsible practices. While not mandatory for all, ESG disclosures are increasingly expected by investors, regulators, and customers.

Key points:

- Identify which ESG topics are most relevant to your business — e.g. energy use, waste, employee wellbeing, board diversity, or supply chain ethics.  
- Track basic environmental metrics: electricity, heating, water usage, and waste volumes.  
- Record social indicators: staff turnover, gender balance, training hours, and health & safety incidents.  
- Document governance practices: board structure, decision-making processes, conflict of interest policies, and whistleblowing mechanisms.  
- Use plain language and avoid jargon — ESG reports should be understandable to non-experts.  
- Align with recognised frameworks if possible (e.g. GRI, SASB, or CSRD for larger entities).  
- Include both qualitative and quantitative data — explain your policies and show your progress.  
- Be transparent about gaps or areas for improvement. ESG reporting is about progress, not perfection.  
- Publish ESG information on your website or in annual reports. Even a short summary builds trust.  
- Review ESG metrics annually and update your disclosures accordingly.

**Tip:** Start small — a one-page ESG summary is better than nothing and shows commitment to responsible business.
