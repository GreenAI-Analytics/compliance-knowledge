Irish employers must promote equality and may be required to report diversity metrics under national and EU rules. Transparent reporting supports inclusion, accountability, and legal compliance.

Key points:

- Comply with the **Employment Equality Acts** — prohibit discrimination on nine grounds including gender, age, disability, and ethnicity.  
- Larger employers may be required to publish **gender pay gap reports** — including average pay, bonuses, and representation.  
- Collect diversity data ethically — ensure it’s voluntary, anonymous, and used only for inclusion purposes.  
- Include equality metrics in **HR dashboards, ESG reports, or board updates** — track trends and gaps.  
- Monitor recruitment, promotion, and retention — identify barriers or bias in processes.  
- Set **diversity targets or action plans** — e.g. gender balance, disability inclusion, or minority representation.  
- Train staff on **unconscious bias, inclusive leadership, and respectful communication**.  
- Consult with employees and representative groups — involve them in shaping policies and priorities.  
- Review equality policies annually — update based on feedback, legal changes, or audit findings.  
- Cooperate with the **Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC)** if audited or investigated.

**Tip:** Use the [IHREC’s employer toolkit](https://www.ihrec.ie/) to build inclusive policies and meet reporting obligations.
