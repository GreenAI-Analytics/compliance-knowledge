Irish businesses must carry appropriate insurance to manage risk, meet legal obligations, and protect assets. Coverage depends on sector, size, and activities.

Key points:

- **Employers’ Liability Insurance** is mandatory — covers workplace injuries and illness claims by employees.  
- **Public Liability Insurance** protects against third-party injury or property damage — essential for customer-facing businesses.  
- **Professional Indemnity Insurance** covers errors, omissions, or negligence in services — common in consulting, legal, and financial sectors.  
- **Product Liability Insurance** applies to manufacturers, distributors, and retailers — covers harm caused by defective products.  
- **Commercial Property Insurance** protects buildings, equipment, and stock — includes fire, theft, and flood risks.  
- **Cyber Insurance** covers data breaches, ransomware, and digital liability — increasingly relevant for all sectors.  
- Some sectors require **statutory insurance** — e.g. motor insurance for transport, clinical indemnity for healthcare.  
- Review contracts and tenders — may specify minimum coverage levels or named insurers.  
- Keep policies up to date — notify insurers of changes in operations, staff, or premises.  
- Retain insurance records for at least **6 years** — including policies, claims, and correspondence.
