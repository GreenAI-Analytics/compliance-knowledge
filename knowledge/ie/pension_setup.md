Employers in Ireland are required to facilitate access to a pension scheme and will soon be subject to mandatory auto-enrolment rules under the new national system.

Key points:

- If you don’t offer a pension scheme, employees can request access to a **Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA)** — you must facilitate this via payroll.  
- You cannot discourage or penalise employees for joining a pension scheme.  
- From 2025, the **Auto-Enrolment Retirement Savings System** will apply to most employees aged 23–60 earning over €20,000 per year.  
- Under auto-enrolment, employers must match employee contributions — starting at 1.5% and rising to 6% over 10 years.  
- The State will also contribute a top-up to each employee’s pension pot.  
- Employees will be enrolled automatically but can opt out after 6 months.  
- Contributions must be paid through payroll and reported to the **Central Processing Authority (CPA)**.  
- You’ll need to register with the CPA and keep records of contributions, opt-outs, and re-enrolments.  
- Review your payroll systems to ensure they can handle auto-enrolment deductions and reporting.  
- Communicate clearly with staff about their rights, contributions, and retirement options.

**Tip:** Use the [Auto-Enrolment hub](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/auto-enrolment/) to prepare for rollout and understand your obligations.
