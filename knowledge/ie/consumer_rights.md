Irish consumers are protected under the Consumer Rights Act 2022 and EU law. Businesses must offer fair terms, clear information, and accessible remedies.

Key points:

- Provide clear **pre-contract information** — including product details, pricing, delivery terms, and cancellation rights.  
- Offer a **14-day cooling-off period** for online, phone, or off-premises purchases — consumers can cancel without reason.  
- Refunds must be issued within **14 days** of cancellation — using the original payment method.  
- Goods must be **fit for purpose, as described, and of satisfactory quality** — otherwise consumers are entitled to repair, replacement, or refund.  
- If a product is faulty, consumers have up to **6 years** to make a claim — though remedies vary over time.  
- Clearly display **return and refund policies** — avoid unfair or misleading terms.  
- Do not exclude statutory rights — disclaimers like “no refunds” are not valid for faulty goods.  
- Provide **receipts or proof of purchase** — this helps with returns and dispute resolution.  
- Train staff on consumer rights — especially those handling sales, support, or complaints.  
- Cooperate with the **Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)** in case of disputes or inspections.

**Tip:** Use the [CCPC’s business guidance](https://www.ccpc.ie/) to align your sales practices with consumer law.
