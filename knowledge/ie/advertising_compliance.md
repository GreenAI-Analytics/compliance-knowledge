Advertising must be honest, fair, and not misleading. Businesses are legally responsible for the claims they make in promotions, packaging, and online content.

Key points:

- Ensure all **advertising claims are truthful and evidence-based** — avoid exaggeration or vague promises.  
- Clearly display **prices, terms, and conditions** — especially for discounts, bundles, or limited-time offers.  
- Avoid **bait advertising** — don’t promote products you can’t supply in reasonable quantities.  
- Use **fair comparisons** — if referencing competitors, ensure claims are accurate and not disparaging.  
- Label **advertorials and influencer content** clearly — consumers must know when they’re viewing paid promotions.  
- Don’t target children with misleading or inappropriate content — follow age-appropriate standards.  
- Respect **data protection rules** when using customer data for marketing — get consent and offer opt-outs.  
- Include a **privacy notice** in email campaigns and online forms.  
- Avoid pressure tactics — such as countdown timers or false scarcity — that could mislead consumers.  
- Monitor third-party marketing partners and affiliates — you’re responsible for their conduct too.

**Tip:** Use the [ASAI Code of Standards](https://www.asai.ie/) to check your advertising against Irish best practice.
