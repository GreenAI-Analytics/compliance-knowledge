Employers have a duty of care to support employee wellbeing, including mental health. A positive work environment improves retention, performance, and legal compliance.

Key points:

- Promote a culture of **respect, inclusion, and psychological safety** — discourage bullying, harassment, and stigma.  
- Include wellbeing in your **HR policies and employee handbook** — outline supports and expectations.  
- Offer access to **Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs)** — confidential counselling and support services.  
- Train managers to **recognise signs of stress or burnout** — and respond with empathy and discretion.  
- Provide **flexible work options** — e.g. remote work, adjusted hours, or phased return after illness.  
- Encourage regular breaks, movement, and healthy habits — consider wellbeing initiatives or challenges.  
- Support mental health awareness — share resources, host talks, and mark relevant days (e.g. World Mental Health Day).  
- Include wellbeing in **risk assessments and health and safety planning**.  
- Respond to concerns promptly — offer adjustments, referrals, or time off where needed.  
- Monitor trends — use surveys or feedback to improve your wellbeing strategy.

**Tip:** Use the [Mental Health Ireland workplace toolkit](https://www.mentalhealthireland.ie/) to build a supportive and proactive wellbeing programme.
