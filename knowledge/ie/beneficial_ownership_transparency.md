Irish companies must disclose their beneficial owners — the individuals who ultimately own or control the business. This supports anti-money laundering and corporate transparency.

Key points:

- Maintain a **Register of Beneficial Owners (RBO)** — list individuals who own or control more than 25% of the company.  
- File details with the **Central Register of Beneficial Ownership (CRBO)** — required under EU AML directives.  
- Include full name, date of birth, nationality, address, nature and extent of ownership/control.  
- Update the register within **14 days** of any change — e.g. share transfers, new appointments, or resignations.  
- If no individual meets the threshold, record the **senior managing officials** instead.  
- Keep the register available for inspection by regulators and law enforcement.  
- Failure to comply can lead to **fines or prosecution** — including daily penalties for late filings.  
- Cooperate with AML checks — beneficial ownership data may be requested during audits or onboarding.  
- Ensure accuracy — false or outdated entries breach company law and AML rules.  
- Review ownership structure annually — especially in complex or multi-layered entities.

**Tip:** Use the [CRBO portal](https://rbo.gov.ie/) to file, update, and check beneficial ownership records.
