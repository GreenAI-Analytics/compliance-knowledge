Company directors in Ireland have legal duties under the Companies Act 2014. These include fiduciary, statutory, and common law responsibilities.

Key points:

- Act in **good faith and in the best interests of the company** — not personal or third-party gain.  
- Exercise **care, skill, and diligence** — based on the director’s knowledge and experience.  
- Avoid conflicts of interest — disclose personal interests and abstain from related decisions.  
- Comply with the company’s **constitution and board resolutions** — act within delegated authority.  
- Keep proper **books of account and financial records** — ensure accuracy and timely filing.  
- File **Annual Returns and financial statements** with the CRO — avoid late penalties or strike-off.  
- Maintain **registers of directors, shareholders, and beneficial owners** — update promptly.  
- Ensure compliance with **tax, employment, data protection, and health and safety laws**.  
- Cooperate with audits, inspections, and investigations — provide access and truthful responses.  
- Breaches can lead to **fines, disqualification, or personal liability** — especially for reckless trading or fraud.
