The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 (as amended) gives legal protection to workers who report wrongdoing in the workplace. Businesses must provide safe, confidential channels for whistleblowing.

Key points:

- Establish a clear **whistleblowing policy** that outlines what can be reported, how, and to whom.  
- Accept disclosures about criminal offences, health and safety risks, environmental damage, misuse of public funds, or breaches of legal obligations.  
- Provide a **confidential reporting channel** — this can be internal (e.g. a designated manager or secure email) or external (e.g. legal adviser or regulator).  
- Ensure workers know they are protected from dismissal, penalisation, or retaliation for making a protected disclosure.  
- Keep records of disclosures and how they were handled — but protect the identity of the whistleblower.  
- Respond to disclosures promptly and investigate fairly.  
- Train managers on how to handle whistleblowing reports and maintain confidentiality.  
- Review and update your whistleblowing procedures annually.  
- If your business has **50+ employees**, you must meet additional requirements under the EU Whistleblowing Directive — including formal reporting channels and designated handlers.

**Tip:** Use the [Department of Enterprise guidance](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/legislation/protected-disclosures/) to align your policy with current legal standards.
