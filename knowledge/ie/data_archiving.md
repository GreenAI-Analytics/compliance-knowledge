Businesses must retain records for defined periods and securely dispose of data when no longer needed. These rules support GDPR compliance and sector-specific obligations.

Key points:

- Define a **data retention policy** — list what records you hold, how long you keep them, and how they’re disposed of.  
- Retain **employee records** (e.g. contracts, payslips, working time logs) for at least **3 years** under employment law.  
- Keep **financial records** (e.g. invoices, receipts, tax returns) for **6 years** under Revenue rules.  
- Store **health and safety records** (e.g. risk assessments, incident reports) for **10 years**.  
- Retain **customer data** only as long as needed for the purpose collected — review regularly and delete when no longer required.  
- Archive data securely — use encrypted storage and access controls.  
- Document any **data deletion or anonymisation** procedures.  
- If using cloud services, ensure providers meet GDPR standards and offer data portability and deletion options.  
- Train staff on retention rules and secure disposal — e.g. shredding, digital wiping, certified destruction.  
- Include retention periods in your **privacy notice** and respond to data access or deletion requests promptly.

**Tip:** Use the [Data Protection Commission’s guidance](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) to build a compliant retention schedule.
