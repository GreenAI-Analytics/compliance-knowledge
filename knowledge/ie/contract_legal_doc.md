Effective contract management reduces legal risk, improves clarity, and supports regulatory compliance. Irish businesses should maintain structured processes for drafting, reviewing, and storing legal documents.

Key points:

- Use **written contracts** for all key relationships — e.g. suppliers, customers, employees, partners, and landlords.  
- Include essential terms — e.g. scope, deliverables, payment, duration, termination, confidentiality, and dispute resolution.  
- Ensure contracts are **clear, lawful, and enforceable** — avoid vague or unfair clauses.  
- Review contracts before signing — involve legal advisors for complex or high-value agreements.  
- Track **contract lifecycle** — from negotiation to renewal or termination.  
- Store signed contracts securely — use digital systems with access controls and audit trails.  
- Monitor **key dates and obligations** — e.g. renewal deadlines, notice periods, performance milestones.  
- Use **standard templates** where possible — ensure consistency and legal alignment.  
- Record verbal agreements or amendments in writing — avoid informal or undocumented changes.  
- Comply with **e-signature laws** — ensure authenticity, consent, and integrity of signed documents.
