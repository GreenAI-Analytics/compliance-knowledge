Remote work arrangements must comply with employment law, health and safety rules, and data protection standards. Employers remain responsible for staff wellbeing and legal obligations, even outside the office.

Key points:

- Update employment contracts or issue a **remote work policy** — clarify expectations, working hours, equipment, and communication.  
- Ensure remote workers have a **safe working environment** — conduct a risk assessment or self-assessment checklist.  
- Provide necessary **equipment and support** — such as laptops, software, and secure access to company systems.  
- Respect **working time rules** — track hours and breaks to avoid overwork or burnout.  
- Maintain **data protection standards** — use encrypted devices, secure networks, and clear rules for handling personal data.  
- Train staff on **cybersecurity and confidentiality** — especially when working in shared or public spaces.  
- Clarify **expense and reimbursement policies** — e.g. for internet, phone, or office supplies.  
- Promote **wellbeing and inclusion** — check in regularly and offer access to support services.  
- Review remote arrangements periodically — adjust based on performance, team needs, or legal updates.  
- If offering hybrid work, define how office days are scheduled and what flexibility is allowed.

**Tip:** Use templates from the [Health and Safety Authority](https://www.hsa.ie/) and [Workplace Relations Commission](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/) to build compliant remote work policies.
