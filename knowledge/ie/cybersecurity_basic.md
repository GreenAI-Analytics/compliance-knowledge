Cybersecurity is essential for protecting business data, customer trust, and regulatory compliance. Even small businesses are frequent targets for cyberattacks.

Key points:

- Use **strong passwords** and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all business accounts and systems.  
- Keep software, operating systems, and antivirus tools **up to date** — enable automatic updates where possible.  
- Encrypt sensitive data, especially personal information and financial records.  
- Limit access to systems and files based on **role and necessity** — avoid shared logins.  
- Train staff regularly on phishing, social engineering, and safe data handling practices.  
- Back up critical data securely and test recovery procedures — use offsite or cloud-based backups.  
- Monitor systems for unusual activity and set up alerts for suspicious logins or data transfers.  
- Use secure Wi-Fi networks and avoid public connections for business tasks.  
- Have an **incident response plan** — know what to do if data is lost, stolen, or compromised.  
- Report serious breaches to the **Data Protection Commission (DPC)** within 72 hours if personal data is affected.
