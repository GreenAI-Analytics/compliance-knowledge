Procurement rules ensure fair, transparent, and cost-effective purchasing — especially for public sector contracts. Businesses bidding for tenders must follow strict procedures and eligibility criteria.

Key points:

- Understand the **thresholds for public procurement** — contracts above €50,000 (goods/services) or €5,000,000 (works) require formal tendering.  
- Register on **eTenders.gov.ie** — the national platform for public sector opportunities.  
- Review the **Request for Tender (RFT)** carefully — check scope, timelines, evaluation criteria, and submission format.  
- Submit bids **on time and in full** — late or incomplete tenders are usually disqualified.  
- Provide accurate **pricing, technical specs, and declarations** — including tax clearance and insurance.  
- Avoid conflicts of interest — disclose relationships or prior engagements with the contracting authority.  
- Comply with **green procurement and social value criteria** — e.g. sustainability, inclusion, or SME participation.  
- Keep records of bids, clarifications, and correspondence — useful for audits or appeals.  
- If awarded, deliver as agreed — monitor performance and maintain documentation.  
- If unsuccessful, request a **debrief** — understand scoring and improve future bids.

**Tip:** Use the [Office of Government Procurement (OGP)](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/office-of-government-procurement/) for templates, thresholds, and procurement policy updates.
