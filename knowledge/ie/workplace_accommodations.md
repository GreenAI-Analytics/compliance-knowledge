Irish employers must ensure equal access and reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities or specific needs. This supports inclusion and complies with equality law.

Key points:

- Comply with the **Employment Equality Acts 1998–2015** — prohibits discrimination and requires reasonable accommodation.  
- Make adjustments to **workplace layout, equipment, schedules, or duties** — based on individual needs.  
- Engage in an **interactive process** — consult the employee and assess options collaboratively.  
- Accommodations must be **reasonable and proportionate** — not causing undue hardship to the business.  
- Examples include **assistive technology, modified workstations, flexible hours, or remote work**.  
- Do not require medical disclosure unless necessary — respect privacy and confidentiality.  
- Train managers on **inclusive practices and legal obligations** — especially during recruitment and performance reviews.  
- Review accessibility of **physical premises, digital tools, and communication methods**.  
- Document accommodation requests and decisions — retain for at least **6 years**.  
- Cooperate with the **Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC)** if investigated or challenged.

**Tip:** Use [IHREC guidance](https://www.ihrec.ie/) and [EmployAbility services](https://www.employability.ie/) to support inclusive hiring and workplace adjustments.
