### ✅ What Irish SMEs Must Know About HR File Retention

Keeping employee records isn’t just good practice — it’s a legal requirement. Here’s a checklist to help SMEs stay compliant:

- 📁 **Keep core employment records for 3 years minimum**  
  Includes contracts, payslips, working hours, annual leave, and public holiday entitlements (per Organisation of Working Time Act 1997).

- 🧾 **Retain payroll and tax records for 6 years**  
  Required under Revenue guidelines. Includes P60s, P45s, and PAYE documentation.

- 🩺 **Hold health and safety records for 10 years**  
  Includes risk assessments, safety statements, and accident reports (per Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005).

- 📋 **Store disciplinary and grievance records for 1–3 years**  
  Best practice is 1 year after resolution, but retain longer if disputes are ongoing or legally sensitive.

- 🧑‍💼 **Keep recruitment records for at least 1 year**  
  Includes interview notes, CVs, and selection criteria — useful for defending against discrimination claims.

- 🗑️ **Securely dispose of outdated records**  
  Use shredding or certified digital deletion. Ensure GDPR-compliant disposal of personal data.

- 🔐 **Limit access to sensitive HR files**  
  Only authorised personnel should access employee records. Use secure storage and access logs.

- 📆 **Review retention schedules annually**  
  Build this into your HR compliance calendar to avoid over-retention or premature deletion.
