Businesses must carry appropriate insurance to protect against legal claims, accidents, and financial loss. Some types are mandatory under Irish law.

Key points:

- **Employer’s liability insurance** is mandatory if you have staff — it covers workplace injuries and illness.  
- **Public liability insurance** protects against claims from customers or third parties injured on your premises or by your operations.  
- **Professional indemnity insurance** is essential for service providers — it covers errors, omissions, or negligence in advice or services.  
- Consider **cyber insurance** if you handle sensitive data or rely heavily on digital systems.  
- Review **property insurance** for buildings, equipment, and stock — cover fire, theft, and damage.  
- If you use vehicles for business, ensure they’re covered by **commercial motor insurance**.  
- Some sectors require specific cover — e.g. construction, finance, healthcare, or food services.  
- Keep a record of **policy documents, renewal dates, and claims history**.  
- Review coverage annually — update limits, beneficiaries, and risk assessments.  
- Work with a licensed broker or insurer — check credentials and compare quotes.
