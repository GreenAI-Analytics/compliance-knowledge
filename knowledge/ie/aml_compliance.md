Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules aim to prevent criminal funds from entering the financial system. Certain businesses — especially in finance, legal, property, and accountancy — must follow strict AML procedures.

Key points:

- Assess whether your business is a **designated person** under Irish AML law. This includes accountants, solicitors, estate agents, and financial service providers.  
- Conduct a **risk assessment** to identify how your business could be exposed to money laundering or terrorist financing.  
- Implement **Customer Due Diligence (CDD)** procedures — verify identity, understand the nature of the business relationship, and monitor transactions.  
- Apply **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)** for high-risk customers, such as politically exposed persons (PEPs) or complex ownership structures.  
- Keep records of identity checks, risk assessments, and transaction monitoring for **at least 5 years**.  
- Appoint a **Compliance Officer** to oversee AML procedures and staff training.  
- Train staff regularly on AML risks, red flags, and reporting obligations.  
- Report suspicious transactions to the **Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)** via a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR).  
- Review AML policies and procedures annually to ensure they reflect current risks and legal requirements.  
- Cooperate with inspections or audits from the **Central Bank of Ireland** or other supervisory bodies.
