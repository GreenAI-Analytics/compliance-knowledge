Under GDPR, individuals have rights over their personal data. Organisations must respond to requests promptly and transparently.

Key points:

- Inform individuals of their rights in your **privacy notice** — including access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection.  
- Respond to **Subject Access Requests (SARs)** within **1 month** — extendable by 2 months for complex cases.  
- Verify identity before releasing personal data — especially for sensitive or high-risk information.  
- Provide data in a **structured, commonly used, machine-readable format** — e.g. CSV, PDF.  
- Include details of **processing purposes, categories, recipients, retention, and source**.  
- Do not charge a fee unless the request is excessive or repetitive.  
- Keep records of SARs — including dates, responses, and any extensions or refusals.  
- If refusing a request, explain the reason and inform the individual of their right to complain.  
- Train staff on handling requests respectfully and lawfully — especially frontline and support teams.  
- Cooperate with the **Data Protection Commission (DPC)** in case of complaints or investigations.

**Tip:** Use the [DPC’s SAR guidance](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) to build a compliant and user-friendly response process.
