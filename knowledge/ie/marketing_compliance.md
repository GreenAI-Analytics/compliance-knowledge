Marketing must be truthful, respectful, and compliant with consumer protection and data privacy laws. Misleading claims or unlawful targeting can lead to fines and reputational damage.

Key points:

- Ensure all **advertising is accurate and substantiated** — avoid exaggeration, false comparisons, or hidden terms.  
- Comply with the **Consumer Protection Act 2007** — bans misleading, aggressive, or unfair commercial practices.  
- Include **clear pricing and conditions** — especially for discounts, bundles, or limited-time offers.  
- Respect **GDPR rules** when using personal data for marketing — get consent, offer opt-outs, and explain how data is used.  
- Use **double opt-in** for email marketing — confirm consent before sending promotional messages.  
- Honour **unsubscribe requests promptly** — within 5 working days.  
- Avoid targeting minors or vulnerable groups with inappropriate content.  
- Clearly label **sponsored content, influencer posts, and native ads** — use #ad or equivalent disclosures.  
- Monitor third-party agencies and affiliates — you’re responsible for their compliance too.  
- Keep records of **campaign approvals, consent logs, and ad performance** — useful for audits or complaints.

**Tip:** Use the [ASAI Code of Standards](https://www.asai.ie/) to ensure your advertising is legal, decent, honest, and truthful.
