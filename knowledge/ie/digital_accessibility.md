Digital services must be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This includes websites, apps, documents, and internal systems.

Key points:

- Follow the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** — aim for Level AA compliance as a minimum.  
- Ensure **keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient contrast** — test across devices and assistive tech.  
- Use **alt text for images**, captions for videos, and descriptive links — avoid vague phrases like “click here”.  
- Structure content with **headings, lists, and semantic HTML** — improves readability and navigation.  
- Avoid flashing or auto-playing content — can trigger seizures or overwhelm users.  
- Make forms accessible — label fields clearly, provide error messages, and support autofill.  
- Ensure PDFs and documents are readable — use tagged structure and accessible fonts.  
- Include accessibility in **procurement and vendor contracts** — require compliance from third-party tools.  
- Test regularly — use automated tools and manual audits with disabled users.  
- Train staff on inclusive design — especially developers, designers, and content creators.

**Tip:** Use the [National Disability Authority’s IT accessibility resources](http://nda.ie/) to improve your digital services.
