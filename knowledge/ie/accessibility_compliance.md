Businesses must ensure their services, premises, and communications are accessible to people with disabilities. This is a legal requirement under the Equal Status Acts and the Disability Act 2005.

Key points:

- Provide **equal access to goods and services** — avoid policies or practices that disadvantage people with disabilities.  
- Make **reasonable accommodations** — such as ramps, accessible toilets, or alternative formats (e.g. large print, audio, easy-read).  
- Ensure your **website and digital services** are accessible — follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines (e.g. alt text, keyboard navigation, colour contrast).  
- Train staff to interact respectfully and effectively with customers who have disabilities.  
- Avoid discriminatory advertising or communications — ensure language and imagery are inclusive.  
- Review your **physical premises** for accessibility barriers — entrances, signage, lighting, and emergency exits.  
- If you receive public funding, you must meet additional accessibility obligations under the Disability Act.  
- Appoint someone to **monitor accessibility issues** and respond to feedback or complaints.  
- Include accessibility in your **procurement and service design** — ask suppliers about their compliance.  
- Keep records of accessibility improvements and staff training.

**Tip:** Use the [National Disability Authority](https://nda.ie/) for checklists, training, and practical guidance on making your business more inclusive.
