Company directors have legal duties to act in the best interests of the company and ensure good governance. These responsibilities apply to all directors, including non-executive and shadow directors.

Key points:

- Understand your **fiduciary duties** — act honestly, in good faith, and in the company’s best interests.  
- Avoid conflicts of interest — disclose personal interests and abstain from decisions where relevant.  
- Exercise **due care, skill, and diligence** — stay informed and actively participate in board decisions.  
- Ensure the company complies with **company law, tax, employment, and regulatory obligations**.  
- Approve and sign off on **financial statements**, annual returns, and key filings.  
- Maintain proper **books and records** — including minutes of board meetings and statutory registers.  
- Oversee **risk management, internal controls, and compliance frameworks**.  
- Appoint and supervise senior management — ensure roles and responsibilities are clearly defined.  
- Ensure the company is **solvent** — directors may be personally liable for reckless or fraudulent trading.  
- Resign formally if stepping down — notify the CRO using **Form B10**.

**Tip:** Use the [Institute of Directors](https://www.iodireland.ie/) for training, governance templates, and director support.
