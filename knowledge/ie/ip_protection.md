Protecting intellectual property (IP) helps Irish businesses safeguard innovation, brand identity, and competitive advantage. Registration and enforcement are key to compliance.

Key points:

- Common IP types include **trademarks, copyrights, patents, designs, and trade secrets**.  
- Register **trademarks** with the **Irish Patents Office** — protects logos, names, and brand elements.  
- Copyright applies **automatically** to original works — e.g. software, content, designs, and music.  
- File **patents** for inventions — must be novel, non-obvious, and industrially applicable.  
- Register **designs** to protect product appearance — e.g. packaging, furniture, or fashion.  
- Use **NDAs and confidentiality clauses** to protect trade secrets and know-how.  
- Monitor for **infringement or misuse** — online, in products, or by competitors.  
- Enforce rights through **cease-and-desist letters, takedowns, or legal action** — seek IP legal advice.  
- Consider **EU or international registration** — via EUIPO or WIPO for broader protection.  
- Keep records of creation, registration, and licensing — useful for audits, disputes, or valuation.  
- Train staff on IP awareness — especially in R&D, marketing, and partnerships.
