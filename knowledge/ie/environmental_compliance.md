Businesses must follow environmental rules to reduce pollution, manage waste, and support sustainability. These obligations apply across sectors, especially where energy, packaging, or hazardous materials are involved.

Key points:

- Identify your environmental impacts — energy use, emissions, water consumption, waste, and packaging.  
- Comply with **waste management regulations** — segregate waste, use licensed collectors, and keep disposal records.  
- Register with **Repak** if you place packaging on the Irish market. Submit annual reports and pay fees based on packaging volumes.  
- Follow **hazardous waste rules** — label, store, and dispose of chemicals properly. Use authorised contractors and retain documentation.  
- Monitor **energy and water usage** — track consumption and look for efficiency improvements.  
- Avoid pollution — prevent spills, emissions, and noise that could harm the environment or public health.  
- If your business has significant environmental impact, you may need an **EPA licence** or local authority permit.  
- Train staff on environmental procedures and emergency response (e.g. spill kits, containment).  
- Keep records of inspections, waste transfers, and environmental incidents for **at least 3 years**.  
- Review environmental practices annually and update procedures as needed.

**Tip:** Use the [EPA’s guidance hub](https://www.epa.ie/) to check if your business needs a licence or permit.
