### ✅ What to File and When — Tax Compliance Basics

Staying tax-compliant means knowing what to file, when to file it, and how to avoid penalties. Here’s a practical checklist:

- 🧾 **Register for Corporation Tax with Revenue**  
  Do this within 30 days of starting to trade. Use ROS (Revenue Online Service).

- 📅 **File Form CT1 annually**  
  This is your corporation tax return. Due 9 months after your accounting period ends, and no later than the 23rd of that month.

- 💸 **Pay Preliminary Tax on time**  
  Due in the month before your accounting year ends. Estimate 100% of final liability or 90% of current year.

- 📂 **Keep proper books and records for 6 years**  
  Includes invoices, receipts, bank statements, payroll, and VAT records.

- 📤 **Submit VAT returns bi-monthly or quarterly**  
  Use Form VAT3. Pay and file by the 19th of the following month (or 23rd via ROS).

- 👥 **Operate PAYE for employees**  
  Register for PAYE, deduct tax at source, and file payroll submissions via ROS.

- 🧮 **Claim allowable expenses and credits**  
  Includes capital allowances, R&D credits, and small benefit exemptions.

- 📋 **Use a tax calendar or reminder system**  
  Helps avoid missed deadlines and interest charges.

- 🛡️ **Assign someone to monitor Revenue updates**  
  Tax rules change — stay informed to remain compliant.
